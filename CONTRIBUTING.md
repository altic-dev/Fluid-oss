## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### Swift Style Guide
- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible
- Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Include error handling for all fallible operations

#### Naming Conventions
```swift
// ‚úÖ Good
class SpeechRecognitionService {
    func transcribe(audioData: Data) async throws -> String
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
class SpeechService {
    func transcribeAudio(data: Data) -> String
}
```

#### Documentation
- Add documentation comments for all public classes, methods, and properties
- Use clear, concise language
- Include parameter descriptions and return value explanations
- Add examples when helpful

```swift
/// Handles speech recognition with real-time transcription capabilities.
/// - Parameter audioData: Raw audio data in PCM format
/// - Returns: Transcribed text from the audio
/// - Throws: `ASRServiceError` if transcription fails
public func transcribe(audioData: Data) async throws -> String
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies when possible
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage for new features

#### Integration Tests
- Test integration with system APIs (Accessibility, Audio)
- Verify functionality across different macOS versions
- Test with various input devices and configurations

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with different microphones
- [ ] Verify global hotkey functionality
- [ ] Check text insertion in multiple applications
- [ ] Test AI integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Validate accessibility permissions
- [ ] Test with different audio environments (quiet/noisy)

### Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting
1. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your changes work as expected
2. **Update documentation** - Add or update README if needed
3. **Add tests** - Include unit and integration tests
